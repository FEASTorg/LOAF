# LOAF Concept

- **LOAF**

  - Multiple SLICEs can be connected to create a system via a shared communication and power bus connected to a controller to create a system from number of function cards to perform some discrete process
  - This is referred to as a **LOAF** which stands for _Locally Operated Automation Framework_
  - **Example:** A small system that made up of several slices connected to a backplane and controller to coordinate their functions for a localized process â€” e.g., a temperature controller, motor controller, and pH sensor working together to run a bioreactor.
